The first thing I wanted to do was let my previous guests know that I was getting into the editing and marketing business. 

I needed to reach out to all of them and see if there was a anything that I could do to help them with their own project or ventures. 

There were a couple ways to do this. 

### Use the information provided when scheduling a podcast interview with me

DO NOT ADD PEOPLE TO MAILING LISTS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO USE WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION!

There are a few ways to do this.

Pre-planned method - Zapier Integration that adds these folks to a group in your contacts.
It's ugly and very complicated but zapier is built on python so Yay Them!!

You can use the zap to add people that signup to guest on your podcast to your contacts.
You can then use your emailing skills to create a mailmerge email to reach out to them.

I recommend that you make this smarter than your average bear.
