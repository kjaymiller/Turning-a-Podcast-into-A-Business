1. Microphone

4. A Way to Host the Podcast

1-3 are a little outside the scope of this talk, but if you want to talk with me about helping you get your podcast off the ground, That is a service that I provide for both business and individuals.

## A Way to Host your Podcast.
### Components that make up a podcast. 

#### Required Things
- Your RSS Feed
- Your Audio

#### Optional Things
- Intro/Outro
- Shownotes
- Podcast Chapters
- Website
- Sponsors/Patronage
- Editor/Produrer

Depending on your needs, your host can provide Many of these things. Which can help you focus more on the podcast yourself.
There is a cost/feature analysis that you will have to decide on. 

Also, I can't express this enough.
# READ THE TERMS OF SERVICE

Examples of hosts.

Of course if you need an excuse to use some python. 
You can ROLL YOUR OWN SERVICE!

## Do People Do This?
More than you think.
- Talk Python to Me

[I did this](https://github.com/kjaymiller/productivity-in-tech) as well for a long time and I'm thinking [about doing it again](https://test.pypi.org/render_engine).

## Pros:
### It's a great way to learn.
### You control the stack. (Complexity)
Certain things you aren't worried about. 

### You control how much you show and how you show it.

You can provide multiple options for how to present episodes.

### Getting Started, It's Super Cheap (If you don't count time)

## The Transition from Podcast to Business
### Should you even do this?
Needs for a business:
* A product
* Demand for that product
* Access to that customer base

If your product is the ~~podcast~~ ads.
Requirements
- Cost per impression (usually 1,000 downloads): CPM
- Developers have the benefit of a targeted audience which means. 
  - Your impressions can be lower (as little as 500 downloads per episode)
  - Your rates can be higher ($20-$50 CPM for generic ads vs $150-250 CPM)

If your product really is the podcast (Patronage Route).
This is **VERY** difficult to do. The majority of podcasts only make enough to cover their expenses.
