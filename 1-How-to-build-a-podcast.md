1-3 are a little outside the scope of this talk, but if you want to talk with me about helping you get your podcast off the ground, That is a service that I provide for both business and individuals.

## A Way to Host your Podcast.
### Components that make up a podcast. 

#### Required Things
- Your RSS Feed
- Your Audio

#### Optional Things
- Intro/Outro
- Shownotes
- Podcast Chapters
- Website
- Sponsors/Patronage
- Editor/Produrer

Depending on your needs, your host can provide Many of these things. Which can help you focus more on the podcast yourself.
There is a cost/feature analysis that you will have to decide on. 

Also, I can't express this enough.
# READ THE TERMS OF SERVICE
