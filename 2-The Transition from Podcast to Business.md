# The Transition from Podcast to Business
## Do you have to do this?
Absolutely not, in fact you can continue to host your podcast for very cheap.

## Should you even do this?

### Needs for a business:

* A product
* Demand for that product
* Access to that customer base

### If your product is the ~~podcast~~ ads.

[X] A Product (Advertisers)
[X] Demand for that product (_People that would sign up for the products_)
[X] Access to the customer base (_If they listen to your podcast_)

Requirements
- Cost per impression (usually 1,000 downloads): CPM
- Developers have the benefit of a targeted audience which means. 
  - Your impressions can be lower (as little as 500 downloads per episode)
  - Your rates can be higher ($20-$50 CPM for generic ads vs $150-250 CPM)

### If your product really is the podcast (Patronage Route).
[X] A Product (Podcast)
[X] Demand for that product (_People that would sign up for the products_)
[X] Access to the customer base (_If they listen to your podcast_)


This is **VERY** difficult to do. The majority of podcasts only make enough to cover their expenses which you should do.

### If your product is another product/service. 

You can use your podcast (and it's already established market as a way to provide knowledge to your customer base and establish yourself as a professional in the industry. 

- TeachPython
- DjangoPodcast
- Talk Python to Me
- Test & Code
- Productivity in Tech Podcast

These are all great podcasts that connect with people in the python community but they also work as a discovery tool for Teaching/Courses they provide.

DO NOT CHANGE YOUR PODCAST FOR THE SAKE OF MARKETING. YOU ARE BETTER OFF JUST MAKING A NEW PODCAST.
